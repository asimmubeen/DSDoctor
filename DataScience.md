# Data Science
Data science is the process of extracting insights and knowledge from data through the use of various scientific methods, algorithms, and technologies. It combines elements of mathematics, statistics, computer science, and domain expertise to analyze and make decisions based on data.

### Examples of data science applications:

**Predictive modeling**: using data to make predictions about future events, such as stock prices, sales, or customer behavior.

**Customer segmentation**: using data to divide customers into groups based on characteristics such as demographics, behavior, or spending patterns.

**Fraud detection**: using data to identify fraudulent transactions or activities.

**Recommender systems**: using data to suggest products or items that a user might be interested in based on their past behavior.

**Image or speech recognition**: using data to automatically identify and categorize images or speech.
