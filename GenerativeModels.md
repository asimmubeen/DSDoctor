# Generative Models
Generative models in machine learning are a class of models that can learn the distribution of a set of data and then generate new, similar samples from that learned distribution. The idea is to learn the underlying structure of the data in such a way that the model can generate new, unseen data that is representative of the original data.

Generative models can be used for a variety of tasks, such as image synthesis, text generation, anomaly detection, and more. Some examples of generative models include Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and Autoregressive Models (ARMs).

In GANs, two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, are trained together in an adversarial manner. The generator network learns to generate new data samples that resemble the training data, while the discriminator network tries to distinguish the generated samples from the real samples.

VAEs are a type of generative model that use an encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder network maps the input data to a lower-dimensional representation, while the decoder network maps the lower-dimensional representation back to the original data space. The goal is to learn a compact representation of the data that captures the most important features, and use this representation to generate new samples.

ARMs are a type of generative model that use a conditional probability to generate new samples. The model learns the dependencies between different elements of the data, and uses this information to generate new samples by sampling from the learned conditional probability distribution.

Generative models can be a powerful tool for creating new data samples that are representative of the training data, and can be used for a wide range of applications in machine learning and artificial intelligence.
