# Machine Learning
Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that allows systems to automatically improve their performance on a specific task through experience. There are three main types of machine learning:

1. **Supervised learning**: uses labeled data to make predictions.
2. **Unsupervised learning**: uses unlabeled data to identify patterns and structure.
3. **Reinforcement learning**: involves decision making in an environment to maximize a reward signal.
