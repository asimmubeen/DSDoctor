# Machine Learning
Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that allows systems to automatically improve their performance on a specific task through experience. There are three main types of machine learning:

1. **Supervised learning**
2. **Unsupervised learning**
3. **Reinforcement learning**

### **Supervised learning** 
In this type of learning, the algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, meaning that the data includes both the inputs (features) and the desired outputs (labels). The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs, such that the algorithm can make accurate predictions on new, unseen data. Examples: linear regression, [logistic regression](/LogisticRegression.md), decision trees.

### **Unsupervised learning**
In unsupervised learning, the algorithm is trained on an unlabeled dataset, meaning that the data includes only the inputs (features) and not the desired outputs (labels). The goal is to identify patterns or relationships in the data without being told what the outputs should be. Examples: clustering (e.g. k-means), dimensionality reduction (e.g. principal component analysis).

### **Reinforcement learning**
In reinforcement learning, an agent learns to interact with an environment by performing actions and observing the resulting rewards or penalties. The goal is to learn a policy that maximizes a reward signal over time. Examples: playing chess or Go, autonomous navigation.
