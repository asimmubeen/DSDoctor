# Machine Learning
Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that allows systems to automatically improve their performance on a specific task through experience. There are three main types of machine learning:

1. **Supervised learning**
2. **Unsupervised learning**
3. **Reinforcement learning**

### **Supervised learning** 
In this type of learning, the algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, meaning that the data includes both the inputs (features) and the desired outputs (labels). The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs, such that the algorithm can make accurate predictions on new, unseen data. 

Some common supervised machine learning algorithms include:

[Linear Regression](/LinearRegression.md): used to model the linear relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

[Logistic regression](/LogisticRegression.md): used to model the probability of a binary outcome.

[Decision Trees](/DecisionTrees.md): used to model decisions or decisions based on certain conditions.

Random Forest: an ensemble of decision trees, used to improve the accuracy and stability of the predictions.

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): used for classification by finding the K nearest data points and returning the majority class.

Naive Bayes: used for classification by making predictions based on the probability of each class and the likelihood of the features given the class.

Support Vector Machines (SVM): used for classification and regression by finding the hyperplane that best separates the data into classes.

Neural Networks: used for a wide range of tasks, including image recognition and natural language processing, by modeling complex relationships between inputs and outputs.

### **Unsupervised learning**
In unsupervised learning, the algorithm is trained on an unlabeled dataset, meaning that the data includes only the inputs (features) and not the desired outputs (labels). The goal is to identify patterns or relationships in the data without being told what the outputs should be. Examples: clustering (e.g. k-means), dimensionality reduction (e.g. principal component analysis).

### **Reinforcement learning**
In reinforcement learning, an agent learns to interact with an environment by performing actions and observing the resulting rewards or penalties. The goal is to learn a policy that maximizes a reward signal over time. Examples: playing chess or Go, autonomous navigation.
