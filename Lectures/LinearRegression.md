# Lecture on Regression
A lecture on simple linear regression can be watched on youtube. Here is its transcript:
## Introduction
Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. In simple linear regression, we model the relationship between a dependent variable Y and one independent variable X using a straight line.

The equation for a simple linear regression model can be written as:

$$Y = β_0 + β_1*X + ε$$

Where:

$Y$ is the dependent variable

$X$ is the independent variable

$β_0$ is the intercept or the value of $Y$ when $X = 0$

$β_1$ is the slope or the change in Y for a unit change in $X$

$ε$ is the error term, which accounts for the random variation in $Y$ that is not explained by the model

### Example
Let's say we have a dataset of housing prices and their corresponding square footage. We want to build a linear regression model to predict the price of a house based on its square footage.

First, we'll load the dataset and visualize the relationship between square footage and price using a scatter plot:

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('housing_prices.csv')

# Visualize the relationship between square footage and price
plt.scatter(data['square_footage'], data['price'])
plt.xlabel('Square Footage')
plt.ylabel('Price')
plt.show()
```

From the scatter plot, we can see that there is a positive linear relationship between square footage and price. As square footage increases, so does the price.

Now, let's build a linear regression model to predict the price of a house based on its square footage. We'll use the scikit-learn library to do this:

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Create a linear regression object
model = LinearRegression()

# Fit the model to the data
model.fit(data[['square_footage']], data['price'])
```

We've now built a linear regression model that predicts the price of a house based on its square footage. Let's visualize the regression line on the scatter plot:

```python
# Visualize the relationship between square footage and price with the regression line
plt.scatter(data['square_footage'], data['price'])
plt.plot(data['square_footage'], model.predict(data[['square_footage']]), color='red')
plt.xlabel('Square Footage')
plt.ylabel('Price')
plt.show()
```

The red line is the regression line, which represents the best fit line through the data points. We can see that the regression line accurately captures the positive linear relationship between square footage and price.

Conclusion
In summary, simple linear regression is a powerful statistical technique that can be used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one independent variable. We've shown how to build a linear regression model in Python using the scikit-learn library and visualize the relationship between the variables using a scatter plot and a regression line.
