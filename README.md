# Machine Learning and Data Science
Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence concerned with building algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data.

Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data. It involves using data analysis, statistics, and machine learning to support decision making.

In other words, machine learning is a tool used in data science to analyze and model data.
